## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D8CEE6) to convey creativity and professionalism. The choice of lavender intends to suggest competence, without being as commonplace as navy blue.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop, ensuring readability and visual balance. It has some of the purple from the primary in it.
- Accent color: Pale rose (#E6D8CE), analogous to the primary lavender but of much lighter brightness, is applied to highlights like button hover states and section titles.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a humanist sans-serif with personality, used for titles and section headers.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif used for main text for elegance and readability. Pairs well with 'Belleza'.
- Use simple, professional icons in a consistent style to represent different skills and sections.
- Implement a clean, well-structured layout with clear sections and a visual hierarchy to guide the user through the portfolio.
